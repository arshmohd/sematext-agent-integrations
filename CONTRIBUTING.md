# Contributing New Sematext Agent Integrations
New integrations require no coding and involve only config files.  The config files use YML (aka YAML) format.  They specify the source of data (e.g. API, port...) as well as metrics to collect.  One can also provide short metric labels and longer metric descriptions.  Operations on collected data can also be configured.

Refer to [Steps to Add New Integration](https://github.com/sematext/sematext-agent-java/blob/master/docs/add-new-integration.md) in the Sematext App Agent repo for more info.

# Submitting Your Integration
