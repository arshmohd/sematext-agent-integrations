# Contributing New Sematext Agent Integrations
New integrations require no coding and involve only config files.  The config files use YML (aka YAML) format.  They specify the source of data (e.g. API, port...) as well as metrics to collect.  One can also provide short metric labels and longer metric descriptions.  Operations on collected data can also be configured.

# Submitting Your Integration
When done working on and testing your new integration just submit a pull request to have Sematext review and merge your integration.
